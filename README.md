About Dataset

Motivation
Being a huge fan of anime and manga myself, I was not able to find a good dataset containing a wide variety of anime and manga titles that could satisfy my needs. So, I decided to create this dataset for all the anime otakus like me in the Kaggle community who are looking to get insights into their favorite mangas and anime.


Description

This dataset has been scraped from MyAnimeList and contains information about all the anime and manga currently listed on MyAnimeList. It contains separate files, one for anime and the other for manga. The features are explained below:-

Use cases
The dataset can be used for a variety of purposes including exploratory data analysis and visualization, predictive modeling tasks, and much more. Also, try merging the anime and manga files for some exciting insights. Good luck!
